                        Missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)—
                        widely known as Mormon missionaries—are volunteer representatives of the LDS 
                        Church who engage variously in proselytizing, church service, humanitarian aid, 
                        and community service. Mormon missionaries may serve on a full- or part-time basis, 
                        depending on the assignment, and are organized geographically into missions. The mission 
                        assignment could be to any one of the 421[1] missions organized worldwide.
                    </p>

                        The LDS Church is one of the most active modern practitioners of missionary work, 
                        reporting that it had more than 70,000 full-time missionaries worldwide at the end 
                        of 2016[1] (as well as more than 33,000 part-time church-service missionaries).[1] 
                        Most full-time LDS missionaries are single young men and women in their late teens 
                        and early twenties and older couples no longer with children in the home. Missionaries 
                        are often assigned to serve far from their homes, including in other countries. Many 
                        missionaries learn a new language at a missionary training center as part of their assignment.
                         Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 1 to 3 years for older 
                         couples. The LDS Church strongly encourages, but does not require, missionary service for young men. 
                         All Mormon missionaries serve voluntarily and do not receive a salary for their work; they typically 
                         finance missions themselves or with assistance from family or other church members. Many Latter-day 
                         Saints save money during their teenage years to cover their mission expenses.
